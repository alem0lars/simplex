{"body":"# Simplex\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nSimplex is a optimization software for linear problems.\r\nIt aims to be as much generic as possible to be able to substitute computing algorithms on-demand, **dynamically**.\r\n\r\nIt is also instructive because of its design principles.\r\n\r\n## Problem examples\r\n\r\n- Example1\r\nmin f(x) = -x1 -x2\r\ns.t. 6x1 + 4x2 <= 24\r\n     3x1 - 2x2 <= 6\r\n\r\n- Example2\r\nmin f(x) = x1 + x3\r\ns.t. x1 + 2x2 <= 5\r\n     x2 + 2x3 = 6\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Alessandro Molari](http://molarialessandro.info)\r\n","google":"","name":"Simplex","tagline":"Optimization software for linear problems","note":"Don't delete this file!
